 *
 * Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth
 * largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Note: 
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
